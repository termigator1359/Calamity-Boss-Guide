* **Strategy:**

    * Build your arena on surface, going to space/underground enrages him. The better you get at knowing what he does in each phase, the more likely you are to survive. The general movement pattern consists of a large oval, try to put a platform kinda high up in your arena for refreshing your flight time. Try to spawn his infernadoes in opposite corners of the arena, something like top right, then bottom left. Don't be afraid of his true second phase, it’s not there yet. Also move in an oval shape to try and space out the infernadoes.

* **Strategies:**

    * Strats mostly don't change up until his final phase where he will become invulnerable for some time (use RoD for dodging everything he throws at you). Upon transition he will heal up and you just do what you did before - shoot at it until it dies. When below 66% HP Yharon will start spawning flarenadoes again, and when at very low HP he will begin charging at you constantly. On Death this phase goes fucking ballistic so always keep an eye out for projectiles while doing your ovals. And don’t forget about your minimap.
