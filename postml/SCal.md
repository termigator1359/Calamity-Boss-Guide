* **Weapon explanations:**

    * **Ranger**:
    
       * Heavenly Gale will be your main Brimstone Heart killer due to Photo's reliance on specific positioning.

       * Photoviscerator is pretty much the only ranged weapon at its tier (aside from Drataliornus) that can do decent damage against SCal. Gale is more inconsistent than Photo, and due to Bloodflare explosions splitting with Ele Quiver, good movement can lead to significantly higher dps with this.

    * **Melee**:

       * Ark of the Cosmos will be your main damage dealer.

       * Scourge of the Cosmos (Melee) helps kill the Brimstone Hearts and makes the 1st Sepulcher phase go by very quickly. It should also always be used when SCal is invulnerable (except for the Soul Seeker phase and the final bullet hell). 

       * Exoblade can be an alternative heart killer if you don't want to bother with Scourge. It's also a great weapon to refill your health and regain your dps (Melee Auric gives damage based on your current health).

    * **Mage**:

       * Voltaic Climax will be your main damage weapon. Used for pretty much almost everything in the fight.

       * Yharim's crystal has enough dps to be viable but is generally harder to use than Voltaic Climax.
     
    

    * **Summoner**:
Optimal setups are the following:

       1. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 1 Yharon son, with the rest Mechworms.

       2. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 2 Yharon sons, with the rest Mechworms.

       3. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 1 Yharon son + Godly Soul Artifact, with the rest Mechworms.
       
       4. 1 Cosmic Immaterializer + 1 Yharon son + Godly Soul Artifact + Profaned Soul Artifact, with the rest Mechworms.

       **Note:** Mechworms with less than 5 segments are worthless.

   * **Rogue**: 
  
       * Celestus will be your main damage weapon.

       * Scourge of the Cosmos (Rogue): like Melee, use this one during the first bullet hell, then switch to Celestus when Sepulcher spawns. The eaters from this weapon will help kill the Brimstone Hearts and make the 1st Sepulcher phase go by very quickly. Do this on every bullet hell.

    

* **Strategy:**

   * Supreme Calamitas DOES have a set pattern of attacks, she will do the same thing every time. The only variance is that when she says "Don't worry, I still have plenty of tricks left" she will always fly above you while firing attacks before falling back into place in her pattern loop. I will leave a picture for her pattern below this. Try to stay near the ceiling at all times during her bullet hell phases to make the exploding projectiles spawn outside of the arena and break against the arena walls. If you can surround your Scal arena in walls, they can explode farther out and give you bigger gaps to dodge through. 
   
        ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_82.png)

   * In her mobile phase, where she doesn't stick to your sides and flies around, she will choose her attacks randomly. The safest thing to do here is to try and move from one side of the arena to the other in the shape of an “U”. Move decently quickly but pay attention; you don’t want to get sniped by any of her projectiles. In her 2nd phase, she charges at you about twice as often as the 1st phase, so always be on your guard, and be prepared to dodge her charges when she turns black.

### First Bullet Hell Phase

   * Use horizontal movement for the first 5 seconds, mostly vertical movement for the following 5 seconds, and slowly move horizontally to the left for the last 5 seconds.

   * If you're Melee or Throwing, use Scourge of the Cosmos to pile up the eaters during this phase. Then switch to your main weapon after this phase ends. This will speeds up the next phase considerably.	

   * This tactic also works with other classes, though a bit less effectively. If you’re Mage, use Voltaic Climax to create in advance during the last few seconds of this phase a couple orb rings in the spots where the Brimstone Hearts will spawn.
   
### First Sepulcher Phase
   * Focus on the brimstone hearts: the longer Sepulcher stays alive the more unnecessary hits you will take. 

   * When SCal positions herself on your sides move vertically to dodge her projectiles (if moving downwards you want to do “short hops” while flying so you properly go between shots). 

   * You should try to end this phase at the upper half of the arena.


### Second Bullet Hell Phase

   * Stay at the top right corner of the arena. The Gigablasts ![image alt text](../public/Giga_Blast.gif) will spawn from either the top or from the right side of the screen. 

   * Try to not stay too close to the walls, as you might get stuck in between all the brimstone blasts.

### Third Bullet Hell Phase

   * Stay in the upper half of the arena, both the Gigablasts ![image alt text](../public/Giga_Blast.gif) and Abyssal Fireblasts ![image alt text](../public/Abyssal_Fireblast.gif) spawn from only the top of the screen. 
   
   * Watch out for the Abyssal Souls rings ![image alt text](../public/Abyssal_Soul.gif) that may overlap each other.

### Brothers Phase

   * The brothers are not very dangerous, their only attack is firing a single brimstone blast down at you. Be careful when moving diagonally upwards as you can get sniped easily.


   * Dodge by moving mostly vertically.

   * Try to end this phase in the upper half of the arena.

### Fourth Bullet Hell Phase

   * This phase is basically the same as the 3rd bullet hell, but when you see a Brimstone Monster ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_87.png) spawn from the top of the screen slowly move downwards. As you progress in the fight more and more of them will appear, you can however stack them on top of each other effectively mitigating the extra numbers completely.

**Note:** From this phase onward you should always be circling around the arena.
Try to not turn around and circle the other way unless you get blocked by a Brimstone Monster or SCal and her projectiles.
   * It’s recommended to try to keep circling in a clockwise direction, as it will make the final bullet hell phase a bit easier to manage.


### Soul Seeker Phase
	

   * For this phase you should use a weapon that can hit multiple of the Soul Seekers at once in order to kill them quickly. 
   * Watch out for the Abyssal Souls ![image alt text](../public/Abyssal_Soul.gif) that the Soul Seekers fire, as they can provide a serious threat in combination with scal's projectiles depending on your movement.

### Final Bullet Hell Phase

   * The picture below describes dodging in this phase in the simplest way possible. Memorize it. 
   
   ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_91.png)
   
   * Or do this, because this is actually a legitimate strat.
   
   ![image alt text](../public/portalbullethell.png)

**Note:** If you somehow end up going in a counter-clockwise circle this tactic will still work, but it will harder to manage because moving up in this bullet hell is very dangerous as the Brimstone Flame Skulls ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_89.gif) will always spawn from the right side of the screen.

Moving counter-clockwise means you’ll be flying up at the right side, which means you’ll be both at risk of getting sniped by projectiles from above while simultaneously being dangerously close to the Brimstone Flame Skulls' ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_90.gif) spawn point. 

### Second Sepulcher Phase
   **Note:** Keep circling.
   * For this phase you can try to circle slower than usual, giving you more time to attack the brimstone hearts; This is risky so be careful when attempting to do so.

      * Summoners don’t have to use this tactic as their minions will attack the hearts independently.

   * If you're unlucky, Sepulcher can spawn in particularly bad spots, possibly getting cheap shots on you with its Abyssal Souls ![image alt text](../public/Abyssal_Soul.gif) . Sadly, not much can be done about it other than trying your best to dodge it as well as everything else SCal is throwing at you.

### Dying Phase

   * During this phase, SCal will be monologuing while staying in place, not attacking. 
The only threats in this phase are the Brimstone Monsters
 ![image alt text](../public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_93.png) (which gain a speed boost during this phase) and any leftover projectiles prior to this phase; however, none of the threats here are actually dangerous at all (aside from Brimstone Monsters, but if you have stacked them they’re completely harmless since you can go in a circle).
 
   * Simply circle around the arena while waiting for SCal to finish her monologue. When she finishes, she’ll be vulnerable again. Attack her until her HP reaches zero.
