* **Strategies:**

   * **Strategy 1**: 5 platform layers (you can get away with 3), each ~15 tiles away from each other, summon the boss and trap the big slimes on the top layer, they will only jump around and spit mines at you, while Core tries to smack you like a pendulum. Focus on Crimulan God since his buffs are much more mediocre than Ebonian or Core's. After Crimulan is dead prioritize getting both Ebonian and Core to the lowest health possible and then pop both of them. Reason to this order is that Ebonian constantly spawns flying slimes after being damaged, which can reach you on lower platforms, and you certainly don’t want to divert any attention to them. Killing the Core first might be tempting, but by doing so you’re just going to launch remaining gods into pre-nerf state where they act like biome mimics.

   * **Strategy 2 - Luigi%**: build this, get into honey, hook yourself to the floor so you don't get warped off the ground, kill the boss (you might fail since this is an old and unstable strat).
