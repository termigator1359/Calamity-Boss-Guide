* **Weapon explanations:**

    * **Any class**: Same as Slime God, Abyss weapons are godly.

* **Strategies:**

    * **Strategy 1 - "I will build a walkway so it's free!"**: Self-explanatory, you build a bridge across half the world, start the fight on the outer edge, walk backwards and fire whatever you have at the poor wall until it dies. Prioritize leeches and hungries that get too close, since if you start taking damage there’s a pretty fat chance you will be juggled between everything and eventually will fall prey to wall’s unyielding assault.

    * **Strategy 2 - "I wanna wing it!"**: Same as first, except you eat a water walking potion and then stagger on buildings while walking on lava.

    * **Strategy 3 - "Melee"**: Only works in Revengeance or higher, you wait for adrenaline and then jump into eyes with Bloody Edge or Night's Stabber effectively reducing boss’ health to 0.

    * Staying semi-close to the wall and walking away slowly can make the lasers have a very hard time hitting you, but you're risking a beating from hungries.
