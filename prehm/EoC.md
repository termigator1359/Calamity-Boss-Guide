* **Strategy:**

    * Make a big platform and run while he tags along. Second layer of platforms would be beneficial for turning around - hook to them and jump off while you're flying. If you're afraid of him hitting you with one of his mad dashes - don't worry, AI tries to predict where you're gonna go next and always misses if you have Hermes Boots at the very least. Facetanking is discouraged on Rev+.
