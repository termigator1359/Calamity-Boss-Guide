# *Basic Calamity Boss Guide*

_**Version: 1.4.0.002**_

Bosses are listed in old progression order, we're not taking non-linearity into account.

Also check out [wiki guide](https://calamitymod.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups).

**Subjectively all-around best weapons are SOMETIMES marked with cursive.**

*Anything with a + on it means "or subsequent upgrades"*

*Ex: Hermes Boots+ means you could also use things like spectre boots, etc.*

*Something that says (optional) means "this is dependent on preference" over “this is recommended”*

*Mostly worked on by drh and whoever's left alive in the team.*
*If you got any improvements then send them over to drh#1109.*

Or plop them over to [discord](https://discord.gg/8hwAmgb).

## Tips and class viability

### General

* How to use accessory lists: first you grab a mobility accessory (wings/boots), then you grab your class accessories, fill the rest with overall good items (like straight damage increases).
* Halibut Cannon isn't accounted for everything, because once you get it - your run is over, might as well just stop trying.
* Yes, you are supposed to use buffs on every boss. Too hard to farm? Blood Orbs. Too lazy to do it? Don't complain about things being hard, I guess.
* Rage and Adrenaline only take base damage into calculations, so Lucky is the preferred modifier if you plan on using them often.
* Half of the bosses, at the very least, are vulnerable to circling. Other half is vulnerable to running away from them.
* When farming money off bosses, turn defiled on for extra profit when opening bags.
* You can still get treasure bags through Armageddon, but I don't know why you'd do that.

### Pre-HM

* **All classes**

    * Even if pre-boss Alchemy Table was removed you can still spawn a boss and waddle into dungeon no problem. 
    <div align="center"><iframe width="620" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAyPsz-rSTg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    * Boots are mandatory for 90% of the fights.
    * __GET A HOOK ASAP.__
    * Warding isn't too bad at this stage, although more damage would be preferred.
    * If in Revengeance or above consider farming King Slime/Desert Scourge for Laudanum/Stress Pills (Laud's much better), gives too many stats packed into one accessory.
    * Goblins are pre-boss, so go ahead and knock yourself out with all those upgraded accessories.
    * Abyss weapons are kings of pre-HM, get them as soon as you kill Skele.
    * Money farms: Crabulon and Queen Bee.

* **Ranged**

    * Worm bosses die to piercing damage real fast (Jester arrows).
    * After EoC you can get Pumpler, which is generally better than Minishark.
    * Conversely, if you want to use Minishark consider using Shark Tooth Necklace, it will increase your damage up quite nicely.

* **Melee**

    * Invest in Seashell Boomerang early, it could easily be your main damage source for the entire stage.
    * Bladecrest Oathsword is also an ok option for "ranged" combat.
    * Claws are iffy to use now, so don't bother (unless it’s Mycelial Claws).

* **Mage**

    * You can easily get an early combo of Wizard Hat, Diamond Robe and Meteor/Jungle Pants and keep it until Titanium/Daedalus armor. Titanium obviously is better.

* **Summoner**

    * AI tends to be extremely stupid, so don't neglect cancelling the buff and resummoning them on enemy’s face.
    * Hive Mind/Perfs summons are somewhat bad due to the fact that they pierce.
    * Hornets and Imps can also go :gun: themselves.

* **Thrower**

    * Grenades are an extremely cheap source of major damage.
    * The sooner you get Raider's Talisman - the better, it’s practically a class emblem that compensates for the fact that you don’t get one on WoF.

### HM

* **All classes**

    * If you're not using wings - you’re doing something wrong.
    * Leaf Wings are the first ones you can get, and you should do that. Or don't, Soul of Cryogen exists.
    * Blood Pact is bad. Yes, that fucking bad. Don't ever use it.
    * Hallowed armor is also bad.
    * Ambrosial Ampoule is only useful for exploration, so don't even think about using it on bosses. Unless you really wanna tank.
    * Right after Clonelamitas dies most classes can skidaddle to the Abyss and get better weapons. Except melee. Typhon's Greed is a meme.
    * Everyone can ignore GSS, the only "good" weapon is Duststorm in a Bottle, and it's pretty much outclassed by any throwing weapon you can get at that point.
    * Money farms: Queen Bee and Ravager (only if you're used to him, he’s quite a pain to nohit, even with post-ML gear, otherwise it’s better to armageddon Queens).
    * If you stock up 30-40 Ravager bags for post-Providence you can get 3000 platinum just for opening them.
    * If you have free accessory slots you can always toss in an emblem.
    * Universal support weapons: Golden Shower and its upgrade - Everglade Spray.

* **Ranged**

    * If you want to have a much easier time with half the bosses - use Daedalus Stormbow. It's not on any boss because it’s stupid and works until Golem.
    * Verium Bullets are the first bullets that are going to home, feel free to make a bunch of them.
    * Terra Bullets are also really good.
    
* **Melee**

    * Terra Blade is the offensive option, Terra Edge is the defensive, pick whatever suits you most.
    * If going for true melee you should stack Violent reforges and grab armors that increase your melee speed (Old One's Army works).

* **Mage**

    * Until you get Ataxia, vanilla armors are going to be better than Calamity's, so don’t get too trigger-happy with your upgrades.

* **Summoner**

    * You'll be stuck with Claspers until Optic Staff, which promptly will be upgraded (read: replaced) into Entropy’s Vigil.
    * "Stupid AI" tip still works, but at this point you might have a lot of slots, so that would overpower the dumbassery of the most neglected class (after the sexually confused melee-ranged hybrid).

* **Thrower**

    * Throwing sucks.
    * No, seriously, your options are going to be HM ore consumables before Cryogen, Ice Stars after Cryogen, Brimblade if you go according to this progression, Ballistic Poison Bomb after Clone, Bracklish Flask after Levi. That's about as much upgrades as you can get.

### Post-ML

* **All classes**

    * ![Yes.](/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_0.png)
    * At this point having Warding prefix on anything is equivalent to giving yourself -4% damage/crit chance.
    * Remember the Blood Pact tip from above? Draedon's Heart joins it.
    * After Polter everyone except ranged and melee should go into the abyss and farm their respective weapons.
    * Before you kill Provi go back to Ravager and farm him for some bags (open them after Provi), that would net you a shitton of bloodstone without you having to suffer through the fattest HM boss.
    * Money farms: Profaned Guardians, Ravager, DoG.
    * Keep Everglade Spray, it's hard to overestimate 20 seconds of Ichor.

* **Ranged**

    * Clockwork Bow is an early "stupid" choice, because it has immense damage output, but doesn't often hit things. It’s the equivalent of random(360). On Providence it should do quite nicely however.
    * Terra Bullets are now bad, don't use them, grab Holy Fire.
    * Post-DoG guns are shit, use bows.

* **Melee**

    * Don't stick to Ataxia.
    * Once Polter ceases to exist - grab Banshee Hook, this is gonna be your best weapon for some time.

* **Mage**

    * Don't forget to eat all the mana upgrades.
    * Don't use Bloodflare btw, it cucks your damage on everything due to a bug. It will be fixed soon though.

* **Summoner**

    * Don't go for Eldritch artifact unless you’re planning on multiclassing with mage.
    * However please do go for Godly, 8 extra minion slots is nothing to laugh about.

* **Thrower**

    * Honestly, there isn't that much to say about throwing, you’re gonna go from Pitchforks to Amputator to Valediction to Executioner’s Blade to Celestus or Scourge of the Cosmos.
