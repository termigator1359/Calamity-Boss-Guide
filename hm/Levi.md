* **Strategies:**

    * On Rev or below, prioritize the siren first before dealing with the leviathan, vice versa for Death. MOAB or Frog Leg is very good for Leviathan to help you fall faster than her once she's enraged (which happens when Siren is dead/always on death.). Put your map in background mode to keep an eye on the siren. You should also note where the siren lure appeared and keep her inside your circles. 

   * Special note: if Siren dies Levi doubles its defense, which in turn makes it extremely hard to kill with on-tier weapons. You know what to do.
