* **Weapon explanations:**

    * **Ranger**: Vortexpopper melts ML as fast as it melts your frames with Chloro bullets.

    * **Melee**: Omniblade can no longer skip phases, but it's still pretty fast. Grand Guardian heals like hell though. Terratomere is a solid choice either way.

    * **Mage**: Swarmer is godly when used with Plague Hive.

    * **Summoner**: You really think you got a choice? Take that dragon.

* **Strategy:**

    * Move away from ML slowly, and take some time to figure out when he's gonna shoot from his hands and stuff. Move away from him constantly but don’t go too far away or he’ll teleport. Use RoD to get on the other side of the Deathray when he uses it. On Rev+, once the gay eye waves spawn, jump up and over ML and start running the other way. This will get most of the eyes stuck behind him, allowing you to kill them from a distance. Also in Rev+ focusing on Eidolists should be your top 1 priority because having 3 more Cultist lightning orbs attack in addition to all the bullshit he has is not something you want to have.
